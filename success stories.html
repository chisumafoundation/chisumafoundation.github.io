        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>

        <p>From that day , since the idea of establishing the Chisuma Foundation was manifested, the foundation has grown to
        blossom as a helper in the Chisuma community. It has undertaken several projects that have been greatly successful. The
        Foundation has also seen itself being registered to be a legal charity organisation under the laws of Zimbabwe, which
        means everything that it does is within the confines of the laws.</p>

        <h1>Chisuma Primary School Block</h1>
        <p>The Chisuma Foundation through Mr Collin Brown who encouraged the launching of the foundation assisted in building a
        classroom block valued at nearly US$30 000. The classroom was completed in 2018 and the plans are that these now need to
        be furnished. Therefore the Foundation seeks assistance from well wishers for material to accomplish this project by
        donating school furniture or funds .</p>

        <h1>Reusable Sanitary Pads Project</h1>
        <p>The Foundation has so far managed to acquire a partner to work with women in Chisuma in sewing reusable sanitary pads.
        This was after a realisation that the cost of disposable sanitary wear has grown beyond the reach of many who stay in
        this community. Women were equipped with sewing machines and they met every Saturday to sew these essentials. The
        Foundation however appeals to donors for some more resources so that the capacity is increased and this is done on a
        larger scale. Donors may chip in in cash or other materials they deem necessary.</p>

        <h1>Annual Sport Event</h1>
        <p>This program has proven to be a darling amongst both the old and young in Chisuma. The crux of this event is to bring
        together people from the community and share life-learning experiences. During the day people interact through playing
        soccer, netball and the previous year has seen chess being added as an essential sporting event.
        We look forward to expanding this initiative through establishing an all year round league so as to keep the teens busy
        and minimise chances of the endulging in criminal activities and other morally unacceptable practises like gangism,
        alcohol abuse and prostitution.</p>
        
        <h1>Food & Nutrition Program</h1>
        <p>Our kids need us to be their heroes. The Chisuma Foundation has thrust upon itself to feed the kids at Chisuma primary.
        The Food and nutrition programme has been implemented through sourcing food stuffs to support the feeding of these
        amazing kids while at school. The program is set to continue for a very long time and the Foundation appeals to all
        well-wishers to assist with food and cash to support the programme.</p>

        <h1>The Bikes Program</h1>
        <p>After realising that some of the students who stay in Chisuma travel a long distance, The Foundation established a
        programme to source bicycles for these children as a way to make it easy for them to go to school.</p>
        <p>he Foundation also wants to open a bike repair centre in the area .
        â€‹
        Bicycles are the most common mode of transport in the area and the potential that lies is that if the repair centre is
        open , the proceeds may be used to support other programmes of the Foundation while they can also help in spreading the
        wings of the Foundation involvement in developing the Chisuma area.</p>

        <h1>School Badges and Rewards</h1>
        <p>Each year Chisuma Foundation makes available badges and rewards for the end of year school celebrations. From having
        grown up in the village, the founders have realised the importance of celebrating and rewarding high achievers at the
        end of the year. These young men and women put a lot of effort to attend school each day. Some are the first to obtain
        education from their families therefore, they do not have much motivation from home. We have found the provision of
        school badges and rewards, a huge point of encouragement for the children.</p>

        <p>Attending these end-of-year celebrations is both humbling and educative to the observer. We encourage all donors to
        attend these end-of-year ceremonies in order to appreciate and understand the work we do. The happiness demonstrated by
        the children is very clear therefore, as a Foundation we believe, we are making a positive impact on the lives of these
        young people.</p>
